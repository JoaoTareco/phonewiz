        Read & save this for later ‚¨áÔ∏è üíæ
                
        Instagram doesn‚Äôt really care if you post daily or, let‚Äôs say, 4 times per week. Some creators consistently grow their audience by posting 3-5 times per week, while others post 1-2 times per day and NEVER grow.
                
        Why is that? ü§î
                
        Okay, HERE are the 3 things:
                
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Great ideas - To simplify, focus on the first 3 seconds of your reel. Make sure your visuals and hook instantly grab attention. Spend 80% of your time on the first seconds of the video, as this matters the most.
                
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Watch-time - This is the most important metric. Maximize it by creating shorter reels, 5-7 seconds long. Aim to consistently hit 90% watch time on these short videos.
                
        3Ô∏è‚É£ Trends - This comes last after the first two but is also crucial. Follow trends and find ways to incorporate them within your niche. Trends could include hooks, audios, and content ideas.
                
        ‚ö°Ô∏è If you can consistently combine these elements mentioned above in each of your new reels, you will eventually go viral. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre posting daily or just 4 times per week.
