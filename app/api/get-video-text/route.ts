Read & save this for later ‚¨áÔ∏è üíæ
        
Instagram doesn‚Äôt really care if you post daily or, let‚Äôs say, 4 times per week. Some creators consistently grow their audience by posting 3-5 times per week, while others post 1-2 times per day and NEVER grow.
        
Why is that? ü§î
        
Okay, HERE are the 3 things:
        
1Ô∏è‚É£ Great ideas - To simplify, focus on the first 3 seconds of your reel. Make sure your visuals and hook instantly grab attention. Spend 80% of your time on the first seconds of the video, as this matters the most.
        
2Ô∏è‚É£ Watch-time - This is the most important metric. Maximize it by creating shorter reels, 5-7 seconds long. Aim to consistently hit 90% watch time on these short videos.
        
3Ô∏è‚É£ Trends - This comes last after the first two but is also crucial. Follow trends and find ways to incorporate them within your niche. Trends could include hooks, audios, and content ideas.
        
‚ö°Ô∏è If you can consistently combine these elements mentioned above in each of your new reels, you will eventually go viral. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre posting daily or just 4 times per week.

Before I started this account I was a full-time UGC creator - (basically I was making ads for brands) ‚ú®Ô∏è
        
This was a service based business and so my income was capped by how much work I could get done.
        
1 sale would result in lots of work! - scripting, filming, editing revisions etc ü´£
        
Although I did enjoy this job, I was burnt out and always chasing my next job üòÖ
        
Once I started focusing on digital products everything changed üëè
        
Now the sales I make get sent automatically to my customers and all I have to do from there is answer questions if they have any!
        
Digital products are not attached to your time in the same way service based businesses are üôå
        
Meaning they have huge potential to scale!
